I will provide a list of cities 

Search Terms: search for terms “marijuana”, “marihuana,” “cannabis”, “moratorium”, and any of the previous terms within 5 words of the word “Ordinance”.   

Timeframe: 1/1/2016 to present. 

Search Locations:
-City Council Meeting Agendas
-City Council Meeting Minutes
-City Planning Commission Agendas
-City Planning Commission Agendas 
-Board of Zoning Agendas 
-Board of Zoning Minutes 
(*NOTE - NOT ALL THESE DOCUMENTS ARE OCRed)

-Keyword search on website homepage

-Search internet news articles during the Timeframe that mention the Search Terms for the city.

Output: Ultimately, I will want the results to be returned in a spreadsheet or database of some type:
-Save a copy of the document that mentions any of the search terms with reference to the page number the search term appears (provide hyperlink to saved location).  
-Provide page number of each mention of a Search Term in a document.
-If possible, pull out each of the search terms with some context.  For example, the 10 words before or 10 words after.
*Note - I will eventually want you to locate an Ordinance if there is a match, but we can discuss the details of this as this gets going.  

-Realtime results: This process is ongoing.  When anything new appears in a Search Location, the Output must be updated with a result.  For example, if a search was done for the February 10 City Council Meeting minutes of a given city, results should be:
-Search was conducted, and Search Term match.
-Search was conducted, and no results were available (i.e. no document), or 
-Search was conducted, and a document was available but the Search Terms did not appear.     

-Calendar: A calendar should be part of the interface, that shows the dates of the future City Council, Planning, and zoning meetings in the cities I provide.
